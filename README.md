Final project

1.1 INTRODUCTION
We want to develop a reservation system for a hospital specifically for covid-19 checkup.
By using our system, people check their symptoms and the system will determine whether he/she
should book an appointment to the hospital. According to who, there are three stages of
symptoms of covid-19 (Media Statement: Knowing the risks for COVID-19). So, our system will
priories the patients with last stage of symptoms and ask them to register for an appointment.
These reservations should be tended to immediately and will be proceeded as soon as possible.
The current appointment systems are general and can be used by everyone for their
problems. But our system is specifically intended to tend to those people who are likely to be
covid-19 positive.

1.2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

1.2.1 BACKGROUND OF THE PROBLEM
We plan to develop our system as a web application. It will be accessible by any web
browser. It can be phone or pc. The main users of our system are the people who are worried that
they may have covid-19 or they are showing some or all symptoms of covid-19. Currently our
targeted users usually go to hospital and queue in long lines to get checked as the hospitals are
usually overloaded now-a-days.

1.2.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT
We all know about the global pandemic that’s going on. During this COVID-19 crisis,
Many people are being infected due to not taking enough precautions. Also, the disinformation’s
that are available online are causing a lot of panic among many people. The hospitals are getting
overcrowded because people are rushing to the hospital with little to no symptoms due to the
panic.
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some
patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, or sore throat. These symptoms
are usually mild and begin gradually. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without
needing special treatment (Media Statement: Knowing the risks for COVID-19). Most people
with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. (What to Do If
You Are Sick)
These 80% people should stay at their home and take care of themselves. If that can be
done, the hospital’s load will decrease a lot and the quality of treatment will increase
proportionally. So, by using our system, we can help the hospital authority to not attend to mild
or common symptoms of covid-19.

1.3 PROJECT OBJECTIVE
At the end of the project we want to create a complete automated system that will help
thousands of people from queueing in a long line or get confused by the wrong information’s that
are online.
People that have only some symptoms can stay at their home and take the required care.
That way they will be less exposed to the virus. They won’t have to go to a crowded place just to
find out that he/she has normal cold.
This project will help the hospital staffs as well. They will treat patients with high level
of symptoms and don’t have to worry about exposing one patient to another patient that might
not be infected. Also, it will reduce the stress on the reception and front-end staffs. The staffs can
focus more on treating the patients rather than tending to the long queue.

1.4 PROJECT SCOPE

1.4.1 Scope
The scope of this project is very big. If the system is efficient, all the hospitals around the
world might use it. The project can also be used by NGO’s to further reduce the hospital staff
stress and help more people faster. Smaller clinics can also use this project to locate and test
potential covid-19 positive patients.

1.4.2 Targeted User
Our target users are people of age that are concerned about covid-19 and wants to know if
their symptoms are indicating that they are covid-19 positive or not and whether they need
immediate medical attention or not.

1.4.3 Specific Platform
The programming languages that will be used are JSP, java, HTML, CSS, JDBC, Servlet
Modules, MySQL. The software that will be used for development are Eclipse, mysql, tomcat.

1.5 CONSTRAINTS
Due to limited time and no sponsor, we won’t be able to host the application on public
server and open the project for usage. We will only be able to host it in our local host and
demonstrate the working model and processes.
